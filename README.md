# quiz-app-vue

This project is a quiz application built with Vue 3. It fetches trivia questions of sports theme from an external API and allows user to answer them.

[Deployed quiz](https://quiz-app-vue-rho.vercel.app/)  

> <ins>Note:</ins> App is not yet finished. I need to enhance its responsivity, add some new features and give it a better overall look.

## Technologies

- Vue 3.4.29
- Typescript 5.4.0
- Vite 5.3.1
- Pinia 2.1.7

## Features

- Ability to go back to any question and change given answer
- Summary view of the user's score.
- Showing answers so far during the quiz

## Setup

If you do not have yarn installed, run the below command first:
```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

To run the app locally in dev mode, paste command below into your terminal and confirm:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ifmcjthenknczny/quiz-app-vue && cd quiz-app-vue && yarn install && yarn dev
```

## Motivation

The main motivation for this task was to build a simple app using Vue to familiarize myself with the framework. Additionally, it served as an entry task for a company that shall remain nameless.
